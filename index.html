		<h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
		<p>Italian cinema has a long and diverse history, but this website was made to explore one genre of cinema: Horror! No matter the time or place, the genre of horror has always pushed the bounds of what is acceptable to show on the silver screen. Follow me <i>(if you dare)</i> as I explore how the Italian horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and how they challenged societal expectations of the time!
		</p>
		<p>The films that I watched were <i>Profondo Rosso (Deep Red)</i> by Dario Argento, <i>La maschera del demonio (Black Sunday)</i>by Mario Bava, and <i>Suspira</i> by Dario Argento. I wanted to explore the relationship between the expectation of a person in society and how it is exemplified/subverted in horror films. I have watched a lot of American horror films, with a focus on the slasher genre, so I know that horror can explore the relationship between people, their gender, and what society expects of that gender.

			<h2 class="title">Black Sunday/La Maschera Del Demonio</h2>
			<p>Sometime in 1630s Moldovia, Princess Asa is accused of being a vampire witch and being in league with the devil. Both she and Prince Javutich are sentenced to death. The people carrying out the execution put a bronze mask on the both of them, the mask has sharp spikes on the inside and the face of the devil on the outside. Before Asa and Javutich could be burned, a storm rolls in a puts the fires out. Two centuries later two doctors are travelling through the area when their carriage breaks down near the crypt that Asa is buried in. Dr. Kruvajan is careless and breaks the cross and glass above Asa. This causes him to bleed onto her, and even this small amount of blood is enough to revive her. Outside the crypt, Dr. Gorobec meets the current princess of the castle, Princess Katia. He falls instantly for her as she is very beautiful. She is also the spitting image of Princess Asa. After their carriage is fixed, the two doctors head into town. After the two men leave the crypt, Asa contacts Javutich via telepathy and he heads to the castle to go kill the current king and prince. However, the king uses the symbol of Christ to drive Javutich away. He then falls ill, and the current prince and princess send for a doctor. Javutich kidnaps Dr. Kruvajan and brings him to Asa, who then turns him into one of her thralls. Dr. Kruvajan then goes to the castle and lets Javutich in to kill the king. Dr. Gorobec then arrives on the scene, confused as to why Dr. Kruvajan suddenly disappeared. Through the help of the townsfolk, Dr. Gorobec figures out that Asa is back and has converted Dr. Kruvajan into a thrall. With a priest, Dr. Gorobec kills Dr. Kruvajan and goes to rescue Katia from Asa. It turns out that Katia is a reincarnation of Asa and she steals Katia's youth to fully revive herself. Dr. Gorobec arrives, determines who is the real Katia, and then the townsfolk finally burn both Princess Asa and Prince Javutich. The film ends with Katia being revived once Asa has burned.

			<h3 class="title">Breakdown</h3>
			<p>I am not the biggest fan of Gothic horror, so as a result I did not enjoy this film as much. It still was a pleasant watch, I just did not find it as interesting or compelling as the other two films. I find it interesting that the Italian dub of this film implies that the relationship between Asa and Javutich is incestuous, while the English dub does not do this. I wish it did. To me, the opening of the film evokes the imagery of the Salem Witch Trials from colonial America. The branding and burning of a woman who was accused of being in league with the devil is almost exactly what happened during that time. In this film, I believe that societal attitudes towards both men and women are on full display here. The protagonists are men and doctors, and their words are taken more seriously than the women of the story. When Katia brings up her concerns in the story, she is dismissed by her brother and her father. What is interesting is that the dynamic between Asa and Javutich is the inverse of the normal dynamic. Asa is shown issuing the commands and Javutich is shown being subservient. The last major thing I noticed was the prevalence of Christ being an ultimate symbol of good, and the one person who doubts religion succumbs to Asa's spell.

			<h3 class="title">Reception</h3>
			<p>An interesting thing to note is that there were two different versions of the English release, the English Language Dubbers Association (ELDA) version and the American International Pictures (AIP) version. Both versions have their own issues. The ELDA version inserts a scene without the approval of Bava, as well a removing a difference scene. The English dubbing was not good or faithful to the original Italian. The AIP version has better dubbing, but removed and shortened several scenes for being "too violent", and they replaced the original score with completely different one with a new composer. When the film was released in Italy, it was uncut by censors. The film was also banned in the United Kingdom until 1968, and even then it was a cut and censored version of the film. It was not released uncut until 1992!

			<p>I had a lot of trouble finding Italian reviews of the time of Black Sunday's release. To be honest, I had a lot of trouble finding any contemporary reviews Black Sunday. Not many magazine or newspaper companies are still around, and if they are, they do not do a good job digitizing their previous articles. I was able to find a New York Times review by Eugene Archer. I would file this review under 'mixed.'

			<blockquote>"...Barbara Steele, a blank-eyed manikin with an earthbound figure and a voice from outer space, is appropriately cast as a vampireâ€”not the Theda Bara kind, but the genuine blood-drinking variety.Mario Bava, ostensibly the director of this nonsense, allows this female Bela Lugosi to quench her thirst four times before she burns, screaming, at the stake before the eyes of John Richardson, her troubled leading man..."

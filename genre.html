			<p>For as long as people have been telling stories, there have been people telling scary stories. These stories range from cautionary folk tales to simply asking the question, "Wouldn't it be messed up if this happened?". The horror genre is broad and is no stranger to pushing the boundaries of what is deemed acceptable to polite society. Since the genre is all about instilling dread and fear, what better a place to explore potentially uncomfortable topics? At least in the United States, the horror genre has never been that popular with general audiences because of that very reason.

			<p>There is an important distinction between the different ways of creating fear within the viewer. Through my research, I have found four distinct categories of creating fear: terror, horror, stress, and scares.
			</p>
			<p> -> Terror is creating fear through anticipation. It is when you can see the shadow of the monster on the wall, yet you cannot see it. It is when you hear the monster right around the corner, just before turning that corner. This way, the audience uses their imagination to scare themselves. Since they do not know what exactly is around the corner, they cannot know how dangerous the monster is. Terror does not only apply to monsters, it can apply to situations in which the audience knows the danger and the characters do not.
			</p>
			<p> -> Horror is creating fear through witnessing something, well, horrifying. It is coming face to face with the monster that was previously hidden in the shadows. It is also seeing something horrifying in general, like someone getting dismembered or tortured. One thing to note about horror, it entirely depends on what the audience finds horrifying. If you are showing a film to audience of horror movie fanatics then you are going to have a much more difficult time instilling fear through horror. On the other hand, you can play off of the audience's fears and phobias, such as claustrophobia, to make the horror more horrifying.
			</p>
			<p> -> Stress, while not creating fear, helps to enhance both terror and horror in a film. When someone is stressed out, they are more on edge. When someone is on edge, they will pay more attention to the scary things in the film. Stress is one of the few universal human experiences. One thing to note is that stress requires the audience to care about the film. For example, if there is a likeable character in the film, the audience will get stressed about their safety. If a character is unlikeable, then the audience will not care about their safety.
			</p>
			<p> -> Scares is when the film makes the audience jump, both literally and metaphorically. Scares include jumpscares, sudden loud noises, and anything else of that nature. The fear that is created does not last long, and in my opinion, is pretty cheap. Jumpscares tend to not hold up through multiple viewings of a film. If there are too many jumpscares in the film, the audience can get fatigued from them. When the audience is too used to the jumpscares, then they do not have an impact anymore.
			</p>
			<p>Now, the real question to ask is: How does horror push boundaries? Due to the very nature of the genre, it tends to explore uncomfortable topics. Usually, the goal of horror films is to scare the audience, so what would be more horrifying than exploring and depicting topics such as pedophilia or incest? Those topics are considered taboo in today's society, and you would probably be labeled as weird or crazy for bringing them up in casual conversation. Not all horror films depict those topics, but horror films do prey on the common fears of society at the time. For example, in Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), there is a scene in which the group of protagonists in a van pick up a hitchhiker. This hitchhiker acts weird and ends up attacking one of the characters, then the group kicks the hitchhiker out of the van. In the USA in the 1970s, the public perception around hitchhiking was that it was a very bad thing. People worried that you might pick up someone very bad, and that fear was highlighted in the film.

			<p>The big years of horror films in Italy were from 1960s to the 1970s. Not to say that there are no horror films in Italy today, just that there was a big boom of horror films made during that time. This was in the middle of the big economic boom that was happening in Italy (see 'History of Italy' page). Early horror films would pioneer the genre, and later horror films would push against both audience expectations and the establishment. The establishment being things that were expected of men and women in society. During this time, horror films were divided into two different camps: the old school gothic horror and the new and violent horror. For the films that I saw, Black Sunday falls into the gothic horror camp, while Deep Red and Suspiria fall into the new horror camp.
			</p>
			<p>Horror films of this time were known for pushing boundaries and showing taboo topics such as incest, pedophilia, bestiality, and more. Due to this consistent boundary pushing, censorship was relaxed in the 1970s. So relaxed, in fact, that horror films seemed to have no limits in what they could show. However, this relaxed censorship only applied to films that were shown in Italy. If a film was shown in another country, chances were it was censored.

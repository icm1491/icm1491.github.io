    		<h2 class="title">History of Italy</h2>
        	<p>During the 1950s, Italy was still a mostly rural country. There were a lot of factories in north-west Italy, but a majority of Italians were working in agriculture. Since agriculture was not exactly the most profitable, Italians started moving away from their homeland in search of a job. Some moved to other countries, such as the USA, and others simply migrated to northern Italy. Many people who left Italy did not return.

        	<p>In Italy, there was a major economic boom from the 1950s to 1970s. The rate at which manufactured goods that were made in Italy increased, and those goods were traded to other countries for a considerable profit. In fact, there were a large variety of goods produced in Italy. This gave Italians of the time higher wages, and that led to more consumerism. Italians had more money to spend on luxuries. One thing to note was that the southern migrants in the northern cities had enough money to invite their families to join them. Northern cities were not prepared for the amount of people who were moving there, and this lead to people living in terrible conditions. Hospitals and other health services also struggled to keep up with the influx of people.
			</p>
        	<p>During this time, there was a cultural conflict with how children in the north were taught differently than the children of the south. Children of migrants often did not understand the Italian that was being taught in the classrooms, and so they were moved down a grade or two. There were also a lot more students than teachers. On the bright side, these difficulties did not last forever. Slowly but steadily, northern cities built proper infrastructure to support the influx of people. By the mid to late 1960s, private companies built enough housing on the edges of northern cities for all the migrants and immigrants. 
			</p>
        	<p>During the economic boom, there were also changes in social and class structures. People who were in the workforce during this time were mostly men, and women were relegated to the home. There was an increase in people who were in the middle class. Since people had more money to spend on goods, many families bought things such as televisions, washing machines, and cars. Speaking of the television, it became very popular during this time. Watching the television became more accessible and it was no longer popular to go to a bar to watch TV. Families who were living together became smaller, for example grandparents, aunts, and uncles were no longer living under one roof. In addition, religion was no longer as important as it was previously. People still attended church, but it was not a major part of their lives anymore. Despite all the new freedoms that living in cities afforded them, women were still confined to the home and preform all the "wifely" duties. Men were also expected to work long days and nights to provide for their families. Each person had a role and was expected to do it, any deviation from the norm was frowned upon. Sex was still a taboo topic, but people were slowly changing their attitudes about it.

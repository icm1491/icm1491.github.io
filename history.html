				<p>- A lot of southern migrants looking for work in the northern labor market</p>
	      <p>- Many families coming to live in northern cities, cities unprepared for it</p>
        <p>- Changes in class structure during economic miracle</p>
        <p>- TVs became popular, families living together became smaller (ex. grandparents, aunts, uncles no longer at home)</p>
        <p>- Less women in the workforce at this time</p>
        <p>- Less people attending church, important because religion is a big part of Italy</p>

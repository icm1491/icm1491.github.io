            <h2 class="title">Horror Genre</h2>
            <p>For as long as people have been telling stories, there have been people telling scary stories. These stories range from cautionary folk tales to simply asking the question, "Wouldn't it be messed up if this happened?". The horror genre is broad and is no stranger to pushing the boundaries of what is deemed acceptable to polite society. Since the genre is all about instilling dread and fear, what better a place to explore potentially uncomfortable topics? At least in the United States, the horror genre has never been that popular with general audiences because of that very reason.

			<h2 class="title">Suspiria</h2>
			<p>An American ballet student, Suzy, transfers to a prestigious school dance school by the name of Tanz Akademie in West Germany. When she first arrives at the school, it is late at night and there is a very bad storm. Suzy sees another student, Pat, flee from the entrance of the school. Suzy is later denied entry to the school, forcing her to seek a place to stay elsewhere. Pat goes and stays at a friend's place for the night. However she and her friend are brutally murdered. The next morning Suzy returns to the school where she meets the head instructor, Miss Tanner, and the headmistress Madame Blanc. Tanner introduces Suzy to Pavlos, a servant at the school, and brings her to where the other students are. Olga offers Suzy a place to stay, since she needs one. But after Suzy passes out during a lesson, Olga refuses to let Suzy stay. Luckily, the school has rooms that Suzy stays in. A girl by the name of Sara has a room next to Suzy, and the quickly become friends. One night, while Suzy is brushing her hair, maggots start falling from the ceiling. They are in all the student's rooms, and this forces all the girls to sleep in the dance studio. During the night, Sara is scared by the hoarse breathing that is just behind the curtain. The next day, the blind pianist's service dog bites the nephew of the headmistress. As a result, he is fired by an angry Miss Tanner. That night, he is ripped apart by his dog in the middle of an empty plaza. Back at the school Sara is getting more and more suspicious about the teachers. She tells Suzy that she refused her entry to the school the night Suzy arrived. Sara promises to show Suzy the notes that Pat left behind. Before Sara can get the notes, however, she is stalked through the school and killed when she tries to flee. Her death is covered up by the teachers, who say she ran away in the early hours of the morning. Suzy is suspicious, and contacts Sara's friend, Frank. They meet and he reveals that her school was founded by Helena Markos, who was allegedly a witch. Frank's colleague tells Suzy that a witch coven cannot survive without its leader. Returning to the school, Suzy finds it empty because everyone went to see a ballet show. She takes this opportunity to sneak around the school to find Madame Blanc's secret room. Suzy recalls the words that Pat said the night she snuck out, and uses that knowledge to find the secret passageway. Going down the passageway, Suzy sees the instructors preforming some ritual act. Pavlos is alerted to Suzy presence, so Suzy hides in the first door she finds. Inside she finds Sara's rotting and disfigured corpse. In order to hide from Pavlos, she goes further in and finds Helena Markos sleeping. Suzy knocks over a decoration, waking Markos up. She takes this time to taunt Suzy, and brings Sara's corpse back to life to kill Suzy. But Suzy is quick and kills Markos by driving a piece of the broken decoration through Markos's neck. As Suzy runs out of the school, it bursts into flames. She smiles as she runs away and into the storm.

			<h3 class="title">Themes Breakdown</h3>
			<p>At first I found this film really confusing, but once I understood what was happening I really enjoyed it. This film had a dream-like quality to it, as there were a few things that were just unsettling or off. I think the imperfect dubbing helped to enhance this film, as it enhanced the dream-like feeling. I also noticed that the women in the film acted very childish. The whole layout of the inside of the school was vague and confusing, and I believe that this was intentional. Another interesting thing I noticed is that when Suzy goes into the headmistress's room, the one with flowers in it, she has to reach up to the doorknob.

    			<p>This film differs from the other two in the fact that it has almost all women as a cast, and the main character is a woman. Also, it seems that the movie had been censored and/or had scenes cut at some point, but I cannot find anything concrete about it. A 4K restoration of the original film is on the Internet Archive.

      			<h3 class="title">Reception</h3>
     			<p>This film is one of the few Italian films to not get an 'Americanized' title upon release. Perhaps the American distributors thought it wouldn't do well? Or perhaps they could not come up with a fitting title? I wish I could find a reason why, but I cannot. I do know for a fact that eight minutes were cut from the film in order to get it to be an R-rated film. Many American film critics that reviewed the movie at the time were on the fence about it. But nowadays this film is considered a cult classic.

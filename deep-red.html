		<h2 class="title">Deep Red/Profondo Rosso</h2>
		<p>The first scene takes place on Christmas of 1956, and a murder takes place off screen. The knife used in the murder falls to the ground in front of a child's feet. Fast forward twenty years, and now we are in the audience of a conference featuring a psychic medium named Helga Ulmann. She claims that she can see the thoughts of people, and suddenly she is overcome by the murderous thoughts of someone in the audience. That same night, a person with black gloves sneaks into Helga's apartment and kills her with a meat cleaver. Marcus Daly, who is a British Jazz pianist, sees the murder while he is talking to a drunk friend, Carlo, outside of a bar. He rushes up to her apartment and finds Helga's corpse, but not the killer. When the police arrive, they question him and initially suspect him to be the killer. A reporter named Gianna Brezzi takes a photo of him, and that ends up in the newspaper. Marcus freaks out because now the killer knows that he saw them that night. After talking with Gianna, Marcus heads over to Carlo's house only to find out that he went out for the day. Carlo's mother, Martha, is home and she mistakes Marcus for being an engineer. Martha seems to be a little out of it, not remembering when Marcus tells her that he isn't an engineer. Marcus eventually goes to Carlo's place to find out that he is gay and sleeping with an effeminiate man. Carlo and Marcus go out and play piano together. That night, after Marcus gets home, the killer shows up and tries to kill him. It proves unsuccessful and now Marcus has more clues to who the killer is. Gianna, the reporter from earlier, helps Marcus investigate. Their investigation leads them to tracking down an author of a book of folklore. This piece of folklore is connected to the murders. Before Marcus and Gianna could talk to the author, the killer shows up and kills her. Marcus gets even more scared, and goes to track down the house that was mentioned in the book. Meanwhile, a man who was helping Helga, goes to investigate the author's death. He seemingly finds out who the killer is, but the killer ends up killing him before he could tell anybody. In the house, Marcus finds a mural of what appears to be a child killing an adult. Disturbed, he leaves the house. After he leaves, a piece of the wall falls away and it reveals another figure in the murder mural. Marcus realizes that a window is missing, so he goes back and finds a decomposed corpse in a hidden room. The killer knocks him out and sets the house ablaze, but Gianna shows up just in time to rescue him. They both go to a school that was connected with the mural, but after arriving Gianna goes to call the police. She ends up getting stabbed off screen, and Marcus finds her. Carlo then shows up with a gun, and threatens Marcus. The police arrive and chase him off, only to have Carlo get hit and run over by a truck. The police think that Carlo was the killer, but Marcus knows better. He goes back to Helga's apartment, only for the killer to show up. The killer was Carlo's mother, Martha, and it is revealed that she killed Carlo's father when he tried to re-commit her to an insane asylum. Martha tries to kill Marcus with a cleaver, but he defends himself. Her necklace gets caught in the bars of a elevattr, and Marcus sends the elevator down and rhis decapitates her.

		<h3 class="title">Themes Breakdown</h3>
		<p>I watched a cut of the movie that included the scenes that were never dubbed into English. So, in some scenes, the characters would switch back and forth from English to Italian and back. I was able to follow along since I had English subtitles for the whole film. I really enjoyed this film as a whole, and I enjoyed Argento's unique camera shot style. 
		</p>
		<p>The whole theme of this film is subversion. I believe Argento challenges (and sometimes reinforces) the commonly held beliefs about men and women at the time. Marcus and Gianna have a whole argument about how Marcus thinks that men are "biologically superior" to women. Even the whole reveal that Martha was the killer is a twist because the characters, and by extension the audience, assumed that the killer was a man. I do not believe that Argento handles the topic of mental illness that well, considering that Martha is painted to be 'insane' even before she killed anyone. I have mixed feelings about Carlo and his boyfriend. On one hand, he is in a very heterosexual-ized relationship where Carlo is "The Man" and Ricci is "The Woman", but on the other hand it is nice to see some form of representation during this time.

		<h3 class="title">Reception</h3>
		<p>This film was released during the height of Italian horror film craze. Critics at the time rated it pretty highly, enjoying the unique camera shots and gore. Even film critics nowadays seem to enjoy the film quite a bit. I was able to find one film critic, Vincent Canby from the New York Times, who wrote a very negative review about the film upon its release in American theaters in 1976.
		</p>
		<blockquote>"Deep Red," which opened yesterday at the Cinerama, 86th Street Twin I and other theaters, is an English-dubbed Italian-made bucket of ax-murder-movie clich√©s thoroughly soaked in red paint that seems intended to represent fake blood. I don't think that Dario Argento, the director, meant to distance us from the action in this way. He's simply a director of incomparable incompetence...

		<p>What is interesting about this film is that Argento himself removed a total of twenty-six minutes from the English release of the film. This footage was never dubbed into English, which explains why my version of the film had both English and Italian audio. I got the uncut version of the film. Other than that, censorship was not really present in the distribution of this film. The only instance of censorship that I could find was the British Board Film Classification (BBFC) cutting eleven seconds due to animal cruelty.
